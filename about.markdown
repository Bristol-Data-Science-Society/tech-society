Welcome! Tech & Society Discussion Group is a fortnightly meetup for students and graduates at the University of Bristol where we talk about how technology and society are intertwined. We're very interdisciplinary and welcome everyone - whether you're a computer scientist, sociologist, engineer, biologist, or philosopher.

Our next meet-up is yet to be confirmed; the last one was held 6-7pm on the 1st February at [The White Bear][white-bear-fb].

(_We typically meet once fortnightly at [The White Bear][white-bear-fb] on a Tuesday, 6-7pm._)
