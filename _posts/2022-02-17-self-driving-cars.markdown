**Reading: ["Self-driving cars will take a while to get right"][reading-link]** by Jack Stilgoe (online Nature article available [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0046-z))

Cars cause thousands of deaths and injuries on the road each year, and many blame human error of drivers for this needless loss of life. Self-driving cars have been proposed as a solution to this problem, but will they actually help reduce road accidents? Do we want self-driving cars in the first place? And when will they reach a point where they will become 'safe' - whatever that means?

This short, 2-page reading from Jack Stilgoe explores these questions and more. We welcome anyone who's interested in the consequences of self-driving cars on society!
