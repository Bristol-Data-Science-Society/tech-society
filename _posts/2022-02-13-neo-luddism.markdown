**Event date/time: 6-7pm, 15th February 2022**

**Event location: [The White Bear][white-bear-fb]**

**Reading: an [edited extract from “Luddism for These Ludicrous Times”][reading-link]** from the blog [LibrarianShipwreck](https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/luddism-for-these-ludicrous-times/)

In recent years, critiquing technology has become ever more common: from automated data harvesting on entire populations by the NSA to concerns that self-driving trucks may put thousands out of work, people are concerned about tech's impact on society. Some even say that we should be turning the clock back on technology, or should dismantle the complex systems that comprise (and govern) our lives.

In this discussion group, we'll be talking about 21st century Luddism (neo-Luddism), the movement against the widespread advanced technologies, for the sake of helping society. We'll be asking questions such as:

- Who are Luddites and neo-Luddites? 
- Should we adopt Luddism and radically re-think what role technology plays in our lives, perhaps banishing technology altogether?
- What really is 'technology', and is its development inevitable?
