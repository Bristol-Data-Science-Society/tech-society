**Reading: ["Donâ€™t Fall in Love on OkCupid"][reading-link]** by Benjamin Winterhalter 

How do we find love? It seems that dating apps have turned the search for romance into a game, one with mindless scrolling, in-app purchases, and a focus on appearances above all else. In dating apps, algorithms mediate your dating choices, and this has the potential to dramatically change the way we look for love.  In this discussion group, we'll be discussing questions such as:

- Do dating apps help people find love?
- How is technology changing romance?
- Can an algorithm identify your perfect partner?
