**Event date/time: 6-7pm, 5th October 2021**

**Event location: The Robin Hood** (which turned out to be closed so we instead went to [The White Bear][white-bear-fb])

**Reading: ["How Normal Am I?"][reading-link]**

For the first Tech and Society Discussion Group meetup, we'll be discussing ["How Normal Am I?"] [reading-link], an interactive demonstration of how artificial intelligence perceives your face. Everyone interested who's a student is welcome to join; we'll be discussing questions such as:

- Can facial recognition really calculate someoneâ€™s age and demographics?
- Is it morally acceptable to have AI assign beauty scores to people's photos?
- What are the ways that facial recognition can be used for good and for bad?
- How are cultural and social values embedded in such technologies?
