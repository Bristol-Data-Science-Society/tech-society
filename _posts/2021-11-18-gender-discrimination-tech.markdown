**Reading: [“Sexism is a Feature, Not a Bug”][reading-link]** by Mar Hicks, a chapter from the book ["Your Computer Is On Fire"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/your-computer-fire)

For the 4th tech & society discussion, we are partnering with [Women in Engineering Bristol](https://www.facebook.com/womeninengbristol)! Everyone is welcome to join; we’ll be meeting at the White Bear to discuss Mar Hicks’ chapter “Sexism is a Feature, Not a Bug” (free PDF [here][reading-link]) about the history of women in the UK’s computing industry, including how discrimination against women led to Britain losing its competitive advantage in computing. The chapter is 20 pages long, so if you’re tight for time, make sure to read pages 138-142 (4-8 in the PDF) and 153-155 (19-21 in the PDF).
