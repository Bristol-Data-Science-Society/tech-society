**Event date/time: 6-7pm, 1st February 2022**

**Event location: [The White Bear][white-bear-fb]**

**Reading: [“Transhumanist values”][reading-link]** by Nick Bostrom

Could technology help humans live better and longer? Could we augment the human body to open new opportunities for individuals and society? Will such augmentation help society thrive, or deepen existing inequalities? 

These are the questions we’ll be asking in this reading group, where we’ll be discussing Nick Bostrom’s [“Transhumanist values”][reading-link]. Everyone is welcome to join us – you don’t need a background in technology/biology to join the discussion, just a curiosity about how technology can be used to change society by augmenting the human body!
