**Reading: [“The Hidden Faces of Automation”][reading-link]** by Lily Irani

According to many, automation is set to make our lives easier and more fulfilling: menial human labour will be eliminated, allowing people to focus on what they really want to do. But is this true? Does automation actually eliminate rote tasks, and will it bring benefits to everyone?
For this discussion group, we’ll be talking about Lily Irani’s article [“The Hidden Faces of Automation”][reading-link], which questions dominant narratives that claim automation eliminates human labour. Irani explores the workers that make platforms like Google and Facebook tick, and why their work is often hidden from view. Some questions we’ll discuss include:
- What roles do humans play in automated systems? Is it likely some of these roles may disappear in the future or not?
- Why are some workers hidden from view, while others (e.g., software engineers and designers) are made highly visible?
- What are the consequences of using contracted workers instead of full-time employees for training automated systems?
